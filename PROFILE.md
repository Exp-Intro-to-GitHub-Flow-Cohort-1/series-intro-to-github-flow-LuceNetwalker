##Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a master Student in Physics at the University of Bonn.
My master project is on the algorithm of EMICoRe which is an improvement on the 
classical site of Variational-Quantum-Eigensolvers. It utilizes Bayesian Optimization
to find optimal measurement points in the parameter space of the Quantum Computer.

My task is to find out, weather this makes the algorithm less susceptible to 
hardware noise on the quantum computer.

##My Hobbies are:
- Photography
- Cooking
- Calisthenics
